For this assignment I will be using the 'dplyr' library which is primarily a set of functions designed to enable data frame manipulation in an intuitive, user-friendly way.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
spi = read.csv("spi_matches.csv")
spi
```
The groupby() function is a very important function in the dplyr library.

```{r}
byleauge <- spi %>% group_by(league)
byleauge
```
```{r}
spi %>% group_by(league) %>% tally()
```


The summarize() function summarizes the data frame into just one value or vector. This summarization is done through grouping observations by using categorical values at first, using the groupby() function

```{r}
spi %>%
  group_by(league) %>%
  summarise(mean_spi1= mean(spi1))
```
```{r}
spi %>%
  group_by(league) %>%
  summarise(mean_prob1= mean(prob1))
```

```{r}
spi %>%
  group_by(league) %>%
  summarise(mean_projscore1= mean(proj_score1))
```
